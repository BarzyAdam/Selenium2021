driver.findElement(By.linkText("Text Here")).click
1-name
2-linkText


3- partiallinkText
also its ane of the 8 locators of selenium
this also allows us to locate the links by thier text ,but is doesnt expect the exact text to passed .on;ey check if the give
text is conatins in the link

its like  String   equals and contain
equals gives true if all same
but contains if just conatin it gives us true
---------------------------------------------

4-id: id is one of the 8 locators
id will licate by matching id attributes value
-id is unique for that specific we element
-id is the best for searching because its uneque if not so we can search for any other name linktext ...
